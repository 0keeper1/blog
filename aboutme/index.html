I started with <strong>Python</strong>, moved to <strong>Rust</strong>, and now I’m focusing on <strong>C</strong>. I enjoy solving problems through programming and improving my skills along the way.<h3 id=bulb-what-i-do>💡 What I Do</h3><p>Programming is how I create tools that help solve real-world problems. I focus on writing code that is <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>fast</strong>, paying attention to how it uses <strong>memory</strong> and how well it performs. Some areas I enjoy working in are:<ul><li><strong>Reverse Engineering</strong>: I like learning how software works at a deeper level.<li><strong>Embedded Systems</strong>: I enjoy working on projects that involve interacting with hardware.</ul><p>At the moment, I’m learning <strong>Android App Reverse Engineering</strong> and improving my <strong>Java</strong> skills.<h3 id=rocket-my-open-source-projects>🚀 My Open-Source Projects</h3><p>I contribute to the open-source community because I believe in sharing ideas and tools. Here are some of my projects:<ul><li><a href=https://github.com/0keeper1/nanotest><strong>nanotest</strong></a>: A <strong>unit testing framework</strong> in <strong>C</strong> that is simple and easy to use.<li><a href=https://github.com/0keeper1/seriallog><strong>seriallog</strong></a>: A <strong>serial port logger</strong> in <strong>C</strong> to help with debugging.<li><a href=https://github.com/0keeper1/braindance><strong>braindance</strong></a>: A <strong>text editor</strong> written entirely in <strong>C</strong>, designed to be simple and fast.</ul><h3 id=dart-what-i-value>🎯 What I Value</h3><p>I always aim to write code that is easy to understand and works well, focusing on <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>performance</strong>. I enjoy solving problems and creating tools that make things easier or more efficient for others.<h3 id=dart-my-goals>🎯 My Goals</h3><p>I want to keep learning, improve my skills, and work on interesting projects. In the long run, I’d like to become a <strong>maintainer</strong> of a popular open-source project that makes a positive impact.<h3 id=coffee-outside-of-programming>☕ Outside of Programming…</h3><p>When I’m not coding, you can find me:<ul><li>📚 <strong>Reading books</strong> to learn more about technology.<li>🎶 Listening to <strong>music</strong>, which helps me think.<li>☕ Drinking <strong>coffee</strong> to stay focused.</ul><h3 id=iphone-let-s-connect>📱 Let’s Connect!</h3><p>You can reach out to me through:<ul><li><strong>Telegram</strong>: <a href=https://t.me/pragma_0keeper1>@pragma_0keeper1</a><li><strong>X (formerly Twitter)</strong>: <a href=https://x.com/0_keeper_1>@0_keeper_1</a></ul><p>Feel free to check out my <a href=https://github.com/0keeper1>GitHub</a> to see more of my work.
