# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mahan

Iâ€™m a software developer with **4 years** of experience. I started with **Python**, moved to **Rust**, and now I'm focusing on **C**. I enjoy solving problems through programming and improving my skills along the way.

### ðŸ’¡ What I Do

Programming is how I create tools that help solve real-world problems. I focus on writing code that is **simple** and **fast**, paying attention to how it uses **memory** and how well it performs. Some areas I enjoy working in are:

- **Reverse Engineering**: I like learning how software works at a deeper level.
- **Embedded Systems**: I enjoy working on projects that involve interacting with hardware.

At the moment, Iâ€™m learning **Android App Reverse Engineering** and improving my **Java** skills.

### ðŸš€ My Open-Source Projects

I contribute to the open-source community because I believe in sharing ideas and tools. Here are some of my projects:

- [**nanotest**](https://github.com/0keeper1/nanotest): A **unit testing framework** in **C** that is simple and easy to use.
- [**seriallog**](https://github.com/0keeper1/seriallog): A **serial port logger** in **C** to help with debugging.
- [**braindance**](https://github.com/0keeper1/braindance): A **text editor** written entirely in **C**, designed to be simple and fast.

### ðŸŽ¯ What I Value

I always aim to write code that is easy to understand and works well, focusing on **efficiency** and **performance**. I enjoy solving problems and creating tools that make things easier or more efficient for others.

### ðŸŽ¯ My Goals

I want to keep learning, improve my skills, and work on interesting projects. In the long run, Iâ€™d like to become a **maintainer** of a popular open-source project that makes a positive impact.

### â˜• Outside of Programming...

When I'm not coding, you can find me:

- ðŸ“š **Reading books** to learn more about technology.
- ðŸŽ¶ Listening to **music**, which helps me think.
- â˜• Drinking **coffee** to stay focused.
